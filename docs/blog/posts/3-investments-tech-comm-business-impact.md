# Why Learning About Investments Can Make Tech Comm Matter More

I've been learning the basics of how businesses are measured—things like EBIT, EBITDA, and why investors and executives care about them. Not to become a finance person, but to understand the language of the room where decisions get made. And it turns out: that language has a lot to do with what we do in tech comm and learning design.

So here's the idea: if we can explain *what* those numbers mean using analogies from our own field, we understand them better. And if we can show how great onboarding and learning experiences *improve* those numbers, we can make the case for tech comm having a real, measurable impact on the business.

## What the heck is EBIT (or EBITDA)? A tech comm analogy

**EBIT** = Earnings Before Interest and Taxes.  
**EBITDA** = Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, *Depreciation*, and *Amortization*.

In plain language: it's a measure of how much money the *core business* is making from its operations—before you account for how it's financed (interest), what it pays in taxes, and (for EBITDA) before you subtract the gradual “wearing out” of stuff (depreciation) and the spreading of one-off costs over time (amortization).

!!! note "Tech comm analogy"
    Think of it like **readability** or **time-to-value** in documentation. You're not measuring every single cost of running the company; you're measuring “how well does the core product of *information* perform?” Good docs reduce support load, speed up onboarding, and cut errors—that’s the “operating performance” of tech comm. EBIT/EBITDA is the business version: “How well does the core operation perform before we layer on financing and accounting rules?”

So: **EBIT/EBITDA ≈ “how healthy is the core operation?”**  
For us: **clarity, findability, and learning effectiveness ≈ “how healthy is the way we help people use the product?”**

## How onboarding and learning experiences improve “the numbers”

Investors and execs care about profitability, efficiency, and growth. A lot of that comes from:

- **Faster time to productivity** — New hires (or new customers) who get up to speed quickly cost less and contribute sooner. That’s fewer “burned” months and fewer people stuck in limbo. Good onboarding and learning experiences directly shorten that curve.
- **Fewer errors and less rework** — When people understand the product or the process, they make fewer mistakes. Fewer mistakes mean less waste, fewer escalations, and often better margins. That’s operating efficiency, the same thing EBIT/EBITDA is trying to reflect.
- **Lower support and training cost** — If docs and learning are good, people don’t need as many live trainings or support tickets. That’s cost down, efficiency up—again, the kind of thing that shows up in “core operations” performance.

So when we improve onboarding and learning, we’re not “just” making things nicer—we’re improving the same levers that end up in EBIT, EBITDA, and the story the business tells investors.

## Learning by playing (and why it fits here)

I’ve always cared about *learning by playing*—making complex things understandable and even engaging. Investment and finance can feel like the opposite: dry, full of jargon. But the same principles apply:

- **Break complexity into chunks** — We do it for APIs and workflows; we can do it for “what is EBITDA and why does it matter?”
- **Use analogies** — Like comparing EBIT to “operating performance of information” or time-to-productivity to “fewer burned months.”
- **Connect to what people already know** — Tech comm folks already know “good docs = less support, faster adoption.” That *is* the same story as “good operations = better margins and happier investors.”

So learning a bit about investments isn’t about becoming a CFO. It’s about **speaking the language of impact**—and then showing how tech comm and learning design are part of that story.

## How tech comm can have greater impact on the business

If we only talk in terms of “pages written” or “courses released,” we stay in our corner. If we learn how the business is measured—EBIT, EBITDA, efficiency, time-to-productivity, cost per support case—we can:

1. **Frame our work in business terms** — “This onboarding redesign will shorten time-to-productivity by X weeks” or “These docs reduced support tickets by Y%.” That’s the kind of language that gets budget and buy-in.
2. **Prioritize what actually moves the needle** — Not everything has to tie to a financial metric, but when we know which levers matter (e.g. onboarding, deflecting support, reducing errors), we can align content and learning to those levers.
3. **Show up in the right conversations** — When we understand EBITDA and operating efficiency, we can sit at the table where “efficiency” and “scaling” are discussed—and argue for docs and learning as part of that strategy.

That’s how tech comm moves from “cost center” to “driver of operating performance.” Not by doing different work, but by **naming and measuring** the impact in the language the business already uses.

*This post is a draft—I’ll refine the analogies and maybe add a concrete example or two (e.g. a before/after from onboarding or support metrics) before publishing. If you have ideas or examples that connect tech comm to EBIT/EBITDA or investor language, I’d love to hear them.*
