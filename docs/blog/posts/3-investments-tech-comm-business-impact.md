# Why Learning About Investments Can Make Tech Comm Matter More

I've been learning the basics of how businesses are measured—things like EBIT, EBITDA, and why investors and executives care about them. Not to become a finance person, but to understand the language of the room where decisions get made. And it turns out: that language has a lot to do with what we do in tech comm and learning design.

So here's the idea: if we can explain *what* those numbers mean using analogies from our own field, we understand them better. And if we can show how great onboarding and learning experiences *improve* those numbers, we can make the case for tech comm having a real, measurable impact on the business.

## My investment journey (so far)

I've been investing for a while now, mainly in index funds and money market funds (that's what "fondos monetarios" translates to in English), and also in some individual company stocks. I love the power of compound interest—not just in career growth, but in actual financial investments too.

But here's the thing: the challenging part isn't the act of investing itself, or even automating it. It's making the decision and commitment to keep going with it instead of constantly trying different things. It's learning to scope yourself so you feel more in control because you're learning about something from different angles, ensuring that the low points don't impact you more than the good ones.

This applies to everything—career, relationships, investments. Commitments work through compound interest too. Getting married, for example, creates compound interest in one way or another. It makes you free knowing your priority and what to focus on.

Now I'm learning about investments more deeply so I can select specific stocks instead of just broad-market funds. I want to know where I'm investing and why, hoping for higher returns. And to do that well, I need to understand what makes a business valuable to investors.

## What the heck is EBIT (or EBITDA)? And why net benefit matters more

**EBIT** = Earnings Before Interest and Taxes.  
**EBITDA** = Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, *Depreciation*, and *Amortization*.

These measure how much money the *core business* is making from operations—before accounting for financing costs (interest), taxes, asset depreciation, and amortization.

!!! note "Tech comm analogy"
    Think of EBITDA like measuring documentation "engagement" without considering the full cost. You might say "10,000 users viewed our docs!" But if it cost you 5 full-time writers, 3 designers, expensive tools, and constant maintenance, was it actually valuable? EBITDA is similar—it shows operational performance but doesn't show the complete picture.

### Why net benefit (profit) matters more than EBIT or EBITDA

Here's the problem: **EBIT and EBITDA can make a struggling business look healthy** because they exclude real costs.

Depreciation isn't just accounting—it represents equipment that actually needs replacing. Interest payments are real money leaving the bank. Taxes must be paid. Ignoring these makes the numbers look better than reality.

**What actually matters: Net benefit (or net profit)**

In plain English: **Did you make more money than you spent?** That's net benefit. That's profit.

Think of it like your personal budget:
- You earn $5,000/month (revenue)
- You spend $3,000 on rent, food, bills, everything (expenses)
- You have $2,000 left over (net benefit/profit)

EBITDA would be like saying "I earned $5,000 and only spent $1,500 on food and utilities!" while conveniently ignoring your $1,500 rent payment. Sure, your "food and utilities performance" looks great, but you're still only saving $2,000.

**The fundamental truth is simpler: Revenue must grow faster than expenses over time.**

If a company reports 30% revenue growth but expenses also grew 30%, nothing really improved—they just got bigger. But if revenue grows 30% while expenses only grow 20%, now you're seeing real value creation. The gap between revenue and expenses is widening. That's actual profit growth.

!!! note "Tech comm version"
    Good documentation should reduce total costs (support, training, errors) MORE than it costs to create and maintain. If your docs team costs $500k/year but eliminates $1.5M in support costs and drives $2M in additional revenue through better user adoption, that's net benefit. That's real value.

This is where **operating leverage** comes in.

## Operating leverage: the compound interest of business

**Operating leverage** (apalancamiento operativo in Spanish) is how a company can amplify its profits when revenue grows, because many of its costs are fixed.

Think of a software company that builds a product once but sells it to thousands of customers. Each new sale has very high profit margins because the main costs—development, infrastructure—don't increase proportionally.

A 10% increase in sales might lead to a 30% increase in profits. That's operating leverage in action.

### How this connects to compound interest and the Pareto principle

**Operating leverage connects beautifully with both compound interest and the Pareto principle:**

!!! note "The Pareto principle"
    The Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, states that roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes. In business, this often means 80% of results come from 20% of efforts, or 80% of sales come from 20% of customers.

- **Compound interest connection**: Just like investments grow exponentially over time, businesses with high operating leverage see their profits compound faster as they scale. The initial effort (building the product) pays off repeatedly without proportional cost increases.

- **Pareto principle connection**: The 20% of effort you put into building scalable systems (automation, documentation, product foundation) generates 80% of long-term value. Companies with high operating leverage have figured out which 20% to focus on—the core systems that serve many customers without proportional cost increases.

This applies everywhere:
- In career development: 20% of your skills generate 80% of your opportunities
- In investing: 20% of decisions may drive 80% of returns
- In technical writing: 20% of documentation gets 80% of user engagement
- In relationships: 20% of quality time creates 80% of the bond

## How technical communication creates operating leverage

And here's where it gets interesting: **good documentation is a perfect example of operating leverage.**

You write it once, but it serves thousands of users, reduces support tickets, and enables self-service. The initial investment compounds over time as more users benefit without proportional cost increases.

But—and this is crucial—**technical communication also has costs.** You need resources to create and maintain documentation. Writers, designers, information architects. Tools and processes.

So the question becomes: **how does investing in technical communication contribute to revenue growing faster than expenses?**

Here's how:

1. **Reduces support costs** (operating leverage): Good documentation deflects support tickets, meaning you can serve more customers without proportionally increasing your support team.

2. **Increases user adoption and retention** (revenue growth): Users who can successfully use your product stick around and upgrade. Better documentation directly impacts revenue growth.

3. **Enables faster sales cycles** (time-to-revenue): When prospects find clear answers in your documentation, sales cycles shorten and time-to-revenue decreases.

4. **Reduces churn** (retention = sustained revenue): Confused users leave. Clear documentation keeps them engaged and successful.

The investment in technical communication should be evaluated like any business investment: **does it help revenue grow faster than expenses over time?**

If your documentation team's cost grows more slowly than the support costs it eliminates and the revenue it helps generate, you've created operating leverage.

## How onboarding and learning experiences improve "the numbers"

Investors and execs care about profitability, efficiency, and growth. A lot of that comes from:

- **Faster time to productivity** — New hires (or new customers) who get up to speed quickly cost less and contribute sooner. That's fewer "burned" months and fewer people stuck in limbo. Good onboarding and learning experiences directly shorten that curve.
- **Fewer errors and less rework** — When people understand the product or process, they make fewer mistakes. Fewer mistakes mean less waste, fewer escalations, and better margins. That's operating efficiency, the same thing EBIT/EBITDA tries to reflect.
- **Lower support and training cost** — If docs and learning are good, people don't need as many live trainings or support tickets. That's cost down, efficiency up—the kind of thing that shows up in "core operations" performance.

So when we improve onboarding and learning, we're not "just" making things nicer—we're improving the same levers that end up in EBIT, EBITDA, and the story the business tells investors.

## Learning by playing (and why it fits here)

I've always cared about *learning by playing*—making complex things understandable and even engaging. Investment and finance can feel like the opposite: dry, full of jargon. But the same principles apply:

- **Break complexity into chunks** — We do it for APIs and workflows; we can do it for "what is EBITDA and why does it matter?"
- **Use analogies** — Like comparing EBIT to "operating performance of information" or time-to-productivity to "fewer burned months."
- **Connect to what people already know** — Tech comm folks already know "good docs = less support, faster adoption." That *is* the same story as "good operations = better margins and happier investors."

So learning about investments isn't about becoming a CFO. It's about **speaking the language of impact**—and then showing how tech comm and learning design are part of that story.

## How tech comm can have greater impact on the business

If we only talk in terms of "pages written" or "courses released," we stay in our corner. If we learn how the business is measured—EBIT, EBITDA, operating leverage, efficiency, time-to-productivity, cost per support case—we can:

1. **Frame our work in business terms** — "This onboarding redesign will shorten time-to-productivity by X weeks" or "These docs reduced support tickets by Y%." That's the language that gets budget and buy-in.

2. **Prioritize what actually moves the needle** — Not everything has to tie to a financial metric, but when we know which levers matter (onboarding, deflecting support, reducing errors), we can align content and learning to those levers. Focus on the 20% of documentation that solves 80% of user problems.

3. **Show up in the right conversations** — When we understand EBITDA and operating efficiency, we can sit at the table where "efficiency" and "scaling" are discussed—and argue for docs and learning as part of that strategy.

That's how tech comm moves from "cost center" to "driver of operating performance." Not by doing different work, but by **naming and measuring** the impact in the language the business already uses.

## Connecting it all back

The more I learn about what makes a business valuable from an investor's perspective, the more I realize how technical communication can directly impact the metrics that matter.

It's all compound interest:
- The skills you build compound over your career
- The investments you make compound over time
- The scalable systems you create in business compound profits
- The documentation you write compounds value for users

And it's all about the Pareto principle:
- Focus on the 20% of skills that generate 80% of career opportunities
- Focus on the 20% of investments that drive 80% of returns
- Focus on the 20% of business activities that create 80% of leverage
- Focus on the 20% of documentation that answers 80% of user questions

For now, I'm just connecting the dots and learning to focus on the 20% that truly matters, with an understanding of how to create leverage in everything I do—whether that's my career, my investments, or the documentation I create at work.
