# Career Compounding Interest Reflection

I studied English literature and linguistics in Barcelona. I spent my fourth and last university year in California as an exchange student. By that time, even though I was studying literature, I was more into writing than reading.

I am not a native English speaker. I'm Spanish and Catalan bilingual. English is my third but kind of second actually as well, since I speak it more than Catalan in may daily life currently. But more about that later.

During my career I've started way too many projects.
