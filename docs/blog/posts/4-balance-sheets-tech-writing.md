# Understanding Balance Sheets Through Tech Writing (Draft Outline)

## Introduction
- Following up on learning about profit/loss and operating leverage
- Now diving into the balance sheet - what a company owns vs owes
- Again: not to become a finance person, but to understand business health and how tech comm fits

## What is a balance sheet? The basic formula

**Assets = Liabilities + Equity**

In plain English:
- **Assets**: What you own (cash, equipment, intellectual property, inventory)
- **Liabilities**: What you owe (loans, unpaid bills, future obligations)
- **Equity**: What's actually yours (assets minus liabilities)

### Personal finance analogy
- You own a house worth $400k (asset)
- You owe $300k on the mortgage (liability)
- Your equity is $100k (what you'd keep if you sold and paid off the loan)

## Tech writing as an asset on the balance sheet

### Documentation = Intellectual Property Asset

Good documentation is an intangible asset:
- It has value that accumulates over time
- It can be transferred (sold with the company)
- It reduces liabilities (support costs, legal risk)
- It increases other assets (customer retention = future revenue)

### The documentation balance sheet

**Assets side:**
- Knowledge base articles
- API documentation
- User guides
- Training materials
- Video tutorials
- Code examples
- Templates and reusable content

**Liabilities side:**
- Outdated/incorrect docs (create support burden)
- Missing documentation (creates risk, slows adoption)
- Technical debt in content (needs updating/refactoring)
- Undocumented features (lost opportunity cost)

**Equity:**
- Net documentation value = quality, current docs minus technical debt
- The actual usable, trustworthy knowledge that users can rely on

## Current assets vs long-term assets in tech comm

### Current assets (short-term value)
- Release notes
- Quick start guides
- FAQ responses
- Status updates
- Timely blog posts about new features

These provide immediate value but depreciate quickly as features change.

### Long-term assets (enduring value)
- Core concept documentation
- Architecture guides
- Best practices documentation
- Foundational tutorials
- Style guides and templates

These maintain value over time and compound.

!!! note "Analogy"
    Like a business balances cash (current asset) with equipment (long-term asset), tech writers balance timely content with evergreen documentation.

## Depreciation of documentation

Just like physical assets wear out, documentation depreciates:
- Product changes make docs outdated
- Technology evolves, examples become obsolete
- Screenshots and UI references need updating
- APIs change, code samples break

**Documentation maintenance = preventing depreciation**

Regular updates and refactoring are like maintaining equipment - they preserve asset value.

## Liabilities in technical communication

### Documentation debt (like technical debt)
- Placeholder pages never filled in
- Promised guides never written
- Known inaccuracies not yet fixed
- Migration guides not updated for new version

### Hidden liabilities
- Support tickets caused by poor docs
- Lost customers due to confusing onboarding
- Developer time wasted explaining things that should be documented
- Legal/compliance risk from incorrect information

## How tech comm improves the overall business balance sheet

1. **Reduces liabilities:**
   - Fewer support costs
   - Lower training expenses
   - Reduced legal/compliance risk
   - Less customer churn

2. **Increases assets:**
   - Higher customer lifetime value (retained users)
   - Better brand reputation (tangible asset)
   - Faster sales cycles (pipeline value)
   - Reusable knowledge base (IP asset)

3. **Improves equity:**
   - Stronger business fundamentals
   - More defensible market position
   - Higher valuation (buyers pay for good docs)

## The documentation equity metaphor

Just like homeowners build equity by:
- Making mortgage payments (reducing liability)
- Improving the property (increasing asset value)

Tech writers build documentation equity by:
- Fixing errors and filling gaps (reducing doc debt)
- Creating high-quality new content (increasing doc value)

Over time, this compounds into a valuable knowledge asset.

## Measuring documentation ROI using balance sheet thinking

Instead of just "pages written" or "articles published," measure:

**Asset growth:**
- % of product features documented
- Documentation coverage metrics
- Freshness (% updated in last 6 months)

**Liability reduction:**
- Support ticket deflection rate
- Decrease in "docs needed" requests
- Reduction in onboarding time

**Net equity:**
- Overall documentation health score
- User satisfaction with docs
- Business impact (adoption, retention, expansion)

## Connecting to compound interest and operating leverage

- Good docs = **asset** that compounds over time
- Each new piece builds on existing foundation
- Operating leverage: write once, serve thousands
- Net benefit: value created >> cost of creation

## What's next

Learning about balance sheets helps us:
- See documentation as a business asset, not just a cost
- Understand how to prioritize (reduce liabilities, grow assets)
- Speak the language when discussing business impact
- Make the case for investment in content quality

**Notes for expansion:**
- Add real example: company acquisition where doc quality affected valuation
- Include metrics example: before/after documentation ROI
- Connect to previous posts about compound interest and operating leverage
- Maybe add section on how investors/acquirers value documentation
