I will talk more about my experience later, but even though I don't fully know yet what this site will be about, one thing is for sure: it will include content about writing, not just technical writing but also creative and even copywriting, and about learning experience design.

And my purpose has been changing or, put it in better words, evolving.</p> <p>The word evolving is key because it reflects one of the more important things I've been thinking about lately: something I just call the career compound interest. I'm sure there's a better way to call it but I will try to explain it now:</p> <p>What do I mean by career compount interest?</p> <p>Ok, so I've actually used chatGPT to search for that. I don't know where I read or heard that concept before, but I'm just rewriting the definition:</p> <p>Career compound interest means that small efforts you make early in your career grow into much bigger rewards later - just like money earning interest in a bank.</p> <p>That may be confusing for some, but lifechanging for others. It's being lifechanging for me at least.</p> <p>Actually, thinking about career compound interest makes fe feel freer. Let me explain.</p> <p>Overall, I just want to live well enough to be able to provide my family with a life better than the one that I'm having now so we can enjoy the better future together.</p> <p>But there are some uncertain events that are impacting my confidence. I even stopped watching the news because it just filled my mind with more chaos than the mess I already had. For example, the layoffs that are happening in the software industry nowadays are truly shocking.</p> <p>Thousands of employees have been laid off in less than one year. I'm still there, but that makes me think about how to bring myself together and regain control of my mental - and corporal too - wellbeing.</p> <p>So I think: Is my career still relevant in the present and future? I guess it is, but how can I feel even more confident about it?</p> <p>Should I evaluate other career options that may reinforce the impact of my role even more than now?</p> <p>What am I supposed to do? Do I need a plan B? Or is it better to just keep the focus on the current plan A as the only plan if we can even call it that way because, really, what's the plan?</p> <p>I've worked in many different things since I was 16 years old. It is not easy to think of myself as a specialist - tho I think I am in one way or another due to the career decisions I've made in the recent years.</p> <p>And the main reason why I'm building this site is to clarify what my professional specialization is, if any, and keep growing my career compound interest.</p> <p>This feels more important than ever for me at this stage of my life.</p> <p>I got married in December (so not even a couple of months ago yet). I traveled to Japan and it was great. I've been with my wife for 15 years now - such a milestone. And the family could grow in the near future. So yeah, job and income stability is critical.</p> <p>And I'm one of the lucky ones because throughout my career I've build many projects and learned a lot of skills - now the question is, how do those skills complement each other towards the same goal? And what is that goal?</p> <p>I think I have some good answers too all those questions. But I just one to keep thinking and writing them down. And writing them well.</p> <p>Because, as the American writer Ambrose Bierce said:</p> <p>Good writing is clear thinking made visible.</p> <p>I'll keep writing, but for now I need to pause. Time for lunch.</p> <p>But I'm happy, I've just written this page in Markdown and -</p> <p>Wait, Markdown, really? - you might be wondering. The answer is: yes. But I'll talk more about that in maybe the 3rd blog post?</p> <p>For the 2nd one, I'll share what my career so far looks like. Brace yourself.</p> <p>(It's funny because I'm writig this to myself basically but I may publish this on a website - I used to be, and still sometimes act as a, web developer).</p> <p>So if I've published this and you've read this, nice!

I was the youngest employee by a significant difference. I was living in a different city and had to take the first train available in the morning to get to work on time.</p> <p>I actually left Bachillerato - which were optional studies before University - just to work because we needed income in the house. And it was a pain, especially for my mother since she wanted me to keep studying.</p> <p>I remember the person who was going to be my boss at the restaurant telling my mother: \"He will study here at the job - there are many things to learn about the food, the ingredients, and operations.\" And my mother was kind of happy to hear that.</p> <p>I did learn a lot. Really. Not just about the food, cleaning, how to make cute coffees when dropping the milk to draw hearts, for example. I also learned a lot about people. You know, you end up greeting and serving a huge amount of people throughout a day, week, and years. And also about how to get along with your teammates. To know your limits by crossing them.</p> <p>I eventually saw some areas for improvement. For example, how to identify and use different cleaning cloths for different areas. We had three: the blue cloth was for the tables where clients sat in the dining area, the pink one was for the toilet, and the white one was for the kitchen. So basic, yet not so easy to know if no documentation or onboarding is done for that. So I created my first technical communication there. It was a drawing that we hung on the wall in the kitchen near the cleaning supplies.</p> <p>First career compound interest deposit</p> <p>Looking back, that simple drawing was my first step into technical communication. I didn't know it back then, but I was solving real problems through clear communication.</p> <p>Almost 2 years later, I became a staff manager. I got promoted. So you can bet I was scared of having to tell people who could be my grandparents what to do. And not just that - other young people and even a few younger than me who had just started for summer jobs. But I think I was still the youngest? I don't remember that well.</p> <p>I just know I learned interesting stuff about the power of words. For example, if I told someone \"do it\", it wasn't that good. But if I told them \"do X while we do Y so that we'll be able to accomplish Z mission\", then it was great. And if I said a word with a negative connotation, others would copy and there would be a more toxic environment. But if I kept optimistic, the environment would just feel awesome.</p> <p>I rejoined classes while working, so I studied in the morning and worked in the evenings. I eventually left the job and did other fast food work while at university - and even worked at a supermarket too for a while.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2026/02/08/career-compounding-interest-reflection/#after-university-the-creator-phase","title":"After university: the creator phase","text":"<p>As soon as I finished university - after having studied in California for the last year as an exchange student and many adventures - I started teaching English to Spanish and Catalan speakers. I taught in different places: schools, academies, 1-to-1 sessions in students' houses, and in caf\u00e9s around different cities.</p> <p>I also self-learned how to build websites and create online courses.</p> <p>Later, I wrote books. I created other courses about writing besides English. I taught at places like Udemy, for example, where I reached over 30k students. And I also freelanced as a writing consultant - copywriting, technical writing, creative writing - and for front-end web development.</p> <p>I became a front-end web developer by self-learning and was employed at a startup that went from around 70 people when I joined to 200 when I left after two years. I learned a lot there. I started in a technical support position and then became a technical writer, creating documentation and onboarding programs for new employees.</p> <p>I left the company to continue learning and building projects on my own. I built over 10 websites about different topics to learn SEO. I created many different social media accounts about each of those topics: how to become fit at home, how to write a novel, home decoration, and English as a second language.</p> <p>The goal was to write about things I was interested in and see if they ranked on Google when people searched for related terms. So I learned to develop blogging and educational websites. This included technical writing to explain how a stationary bike worked, for example, but also summarizing scientific research papers about how to build muscle into plain language via text and video.</p> <p>I also had clients as a freelance writing consultant about many different topics.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2026/02/08/career-compounding-interest-reflection/#where-i-am-now","title":"Where I am now","text":"<p>Eventually I was hired at the company where I currently work as a technical writer, but I do a lot of learning experience design too.

It is also about verifying something works, which is crucial in the age of AI.</p> <p>And also, I think the human experience is going to feel premium. Let's say AI creates something and you say \"ok.\" But if there's a human telling you the same thing, you'll probably feel more inclined to trust the human - provided the information is properly sourced, updated, and verified.</p> <p>Writing is still important. It makes us think. I've seen articles about people becoming less sharp since AI came into play. I think AI is a good partner to help your writing, not replace it. It can help bridge the development phase and the production phase - turning your thoughts into something easy for others to understand.</p> <p>If you don't just let it replace your thoughts, but help it channel them, I can see how it can propel you to an increased career compound interest.

You don't jump from topic to topic. You go deeper\u2014learning about something from different angles, building expertise layer by layer.
